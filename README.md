#  Time Series Analysis â€“ S&P Stock Market Case Study

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on applying **time series analysis techniques** to the **S&P stock market dataset**.  
The analysis explores stock price movements over time, identifies patterns using moving averages, performs resampling, and examines correlations between multiple stocks to uncover meaningful financial insights.

##  Problem Statement
Stock prices are dynamic and influenced by multiple factors. The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze the **change in stock prices** over time  
- Compute **moving averages** to study long-term vs short-term trends  
- Observe **closing price changes** in Apple stock  
- Perform **resampling analysis** to study stocks at different time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)  
- Conduct **multivariate analysis** to understand cross-stock relationships  
- Apply **correlation analysis** to measure dependencies between stock prices

##  Key Features & Analysis
-  **Data Collection** â€“ Gathered multiple stock datasets (S&P companies including Apple)  
-  **Stock Price Change Analysis** â€“ Analyzed trends in opening, closing, high, and low prices  
-  **Moving Averages** â€“ Computed simple moving averages to smooth short-term fluctuations  
-  **Apple Stock Closing Price Study** â€“ Observed price changes in Appleâ€™s stock over time  
-  **Resampling** â€“ Aggregated data to weekly, monthly intervals for trend analysis  
-  **Multivariate Analysis** â€“ Studied multiple stock movements together  
-  **Correlation Analysis** â€“ Heatmap of correlations to detect strong/weak relationships
